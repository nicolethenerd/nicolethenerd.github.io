                    <img src="images/starlogo.png">

                    <p>I worked on StarLogo TNG, a graphical programming environment for students and teachers.  Programmers use StarLogo Blocks, which are essentially on-screen puzzle pieces with commands on them, to control 3-D agent-based simulations.  This software was designed for both teaching basic programming skills and for conveying other fundamental science concepts through simulations (for example, StarLogo TNG has been used to teach about ecology and predator/prey relationships).  However, after the first version of StarLogo TNG was released, we discovered that academic researchers were using our software to build real simulations for their research, due to the simplicity of the programming language and the ease in visualization.  The goal of my thesis was to improve the ability of StarLogo TNG to handle complex agent-based simulations.</p>

                    <img src="images/beetle.png">

                    <p>Collaborators: Paul Medlock-Walton and Yuzhi Zheng
                    For our 6.831 (User Interface Design) term project, my collaborators and I worked in conjunction with the Scheller Teacher Education Program group on a mobile educational game called Beetle Breeders designed to teach high school and college students in introductory biology classes about Mendelian genetics.  The game worked by having students select beetles from a starting "bucket" to breed for different traits (ie. color, number of spots, antenna length), and our task was to prototype an interface for searching for beetles with specific traits in the bucket.</p>

                    <p>Over the course of the semester, we worked through the design process by analyzing the problem, constructing paper and computer prototypes, and performing user tests, resulting in a <a href="http://paulmw.scripts.mit.edu/beetlesFinal/filter2.htm">final prototype</a> of the beetle bucket search page.</p>

                    <p>Note: At the implementation stage, I was personally responsible for icon design.  The center beetle art was drawn by Yuzhi Zheng and the HTML/CSS/Javascript coding was done by Paul Medlock-Walton.  The three of us collaborated on the layout design, discussion, and testing throughout the rest of the project.</p>

                    <p>In optical character recognition (OCR), character segmentation is the process of taking a connected component of text, or “blob” and dividing it into individual characters.  During my summer at Google, I wrote a test framework to be used on the character segmenter in Tesseract, Google's open-source OCR engine, in order to measure it's accuracy and help to determine which types of characters Tesseract had the most trouble with, in order to devise strategies for improvement.  My test framework operated by running Tesseract on computer-generated "fake books" and then comparing the bounding boxes for characters that Tesseract created with those from the ground truth data.</p>

                    <p>MassEdit is an online tool for multi-line editing designed by David Huynh.  As an undergraduate researcher in MIT's User Interface Design Group, I used Chickenfoot to create a script that would run in-browser and allow users to apply MassEdit's multi-line editing capabilities to Google Spreadsheets.  The program would create a tab labled 'Mass Edit' in Google Spreadsheets, which, when clicked, would export selected cells to MassEdit.  The user could then use MassEdit and click another button to import the modified cells back to their original positions on the spreadsheet.  The program was written in Chickenfoot script, a superset of Javascript.</p>
